# .dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configuration, allowing for a consistent computing experience across multiple machines. These days I primarily use GNU/Linux via the Arch Linux distribution.

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using GNU Stow. This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```
stow .
```
